# Google Form Auto Filler üìù

This repository contains two methods for automating the filling of Google Forms: one using Python Requests and the other using Selenium.

## Method 1: Using Python Requests üêç

### Description
This method utilizes the `requests` library in Python to submit data to a Google Form. It is faster compared to Method 2 (Selenium). For even faster performance, you can try the multithreading requests version. It utilizes multiple threads to send requests simultaneously, maximizing the throughput. However, be cautious as it may overload the server or trigger anti-spam measures if not used responsibly.


## Method 2: Using Selenium ‚öôÔ∏è

### Description
This method employs `Selenium`, a web automation framework, to interact with and fill out a Google Form.
